Semi-Convex Hull Algorithm
---------------------------
1. P -> Set of uniformly sampled points on the original high resolution mesh.
2. (M, x) -> Convex hull of mesh where x represents the set of coordinates of vertices
3. Remesh (M, x) uniformly using ***Isotropic Surface Remeshing***
    - Objective is to minimize the E(x) in paper.
    - This minimization is performed by Gradient Descent.
4. Vol(M, x) denotes the set of points inside the mesh M.



Direct Resampling for Isotropic Surface Remeshing
--------------------------------------------------
1. Feature extraction using mesh curvature.
2. Create a new mesh with the same number of vertices and proper sample distribution
3. Produce isotropic placement of the samples by constructing a weighted centroidal Voronoi tesellation (WCVT)



Idx = knnsearch(X,Y) finds the nearest neighbor in X for each query point in Y and
returns the indices of the nearest neighbors in Idx, a column vector.
Idx has the same number of rows as Y.
